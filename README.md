# Classification Pipeline using Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks

This project implements a **classification pipeline** for analyzing and predicting classes using multiple machine learning techniques. The main tasks include:

## Features:
1. **Data Preparation and Vectorization**:  
   - Handling missing data.  
   - Applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.  
   - Splitting data into training and testing subsets.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier**:  
   - Training and visualizing a decision tree.  
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, depth, and number of leaves.

3. **Logistic Regression**:  
   - Implementing logistic regression for classification tasks.  
   - Displaying model parameters (coefficients and intercept).

4. **Multilayer Neural Network**:  
   - Training a neural network with regularization.  
   - Studying the impact of epochs, depth, width, and regularization techniques (L1, L2, and Dropout) on model performance.
